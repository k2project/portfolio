        <p className="Post_subtitle">Each interview will bring you one-stop closer to your dream job if you are willing to learn from the experience.</p>
        <p>I have recently started job hunting for the position of the front end web developer. Being able to secure a few interviews was a great experience for someone who is just about to start their career. Even though I didnâ€™t get the position, it presented me with the chance of reaching out and proactively ask for feedback. I am grateful to everyone, who has been willing to help me out as I am always looking for ways to develop, learn, and grow. On that note, I have come up with my personalised bootcamp plan to improve my skills and to show my potential employer how capable I am of handling a constructive assessment.</p>

        <p className="Post_subtitle">Feedback: the positive and constructive ones.</p>

        <p>Overall I have received a great number of positive comments on my commercial experience and design capabilities. On the other hand, me - being a self-taught developer, it raised a few concerns about the quality of my code. I believe that they can be fairly justified. It's easy to fall into bad habits, without realising it, when learning from different sources. Therefore, the first part of my challenge would be to address these issues along with getting to know better the WCAG standards. I want to be able to create semantically clean websites that are an inclusive and friendly experience to all users. Also, I will be looking for an internship to gain experience within a developers team and preferable agile environment.</p>
