    body:(<div className="Post_body">
        <p className="Post_subtitle">As a self-taught programmer who is trying to make it into the industry, I have realised that most interviewers would address concerns regarding the quality of my code. Learning from many sources and without the supervision of a senior figure makes falling into bad habits easily and that justifies their worries.   </p>
        <p>I agree with Christian Maioli M. that ignoring bad habits would be the worst thing to do. Therefore I have taken these steps to overview and improve the quality of my work. I am determined to show my potential employers that as much as it is hard to break bad habits, I'm willing to try.</p>
        <p>There are many aspects of bad practice in coding: code organization, teamwork, writing code, testing and maintenance. My main focus, for now, would be to overview structuring and writing of my code. </p>

        <p className="Post_subtitle">Naming conventions in programming.</p>

        <p>It can be easy for the beginner to underestimate the importance of naming in your code. It's your code so it seems clear to you what you are writing at that moment, but it takes only a few days to take a break from your work and go back to it only to realise that you are confused with the way you decide to name those variables or classes. Imagine a stranger trying to follow your logic... So as long as the names are descriptive and informative about the code they refer to, other developers will have an easier time reading your code.  </p>

        <p className="Post_subtitle">Best practise.</p>
        <ul className="Post__list">
            <li><b>The intention of the variable should be clear from its name and it should be meaningfully distinct.</b> <br/><small>Writing a comment to make the purpose of the variable clear should make you rethink the name.</small></li>
            <li><b>Do not use variable names which could be misleading.</b> <br/><small>Naming a collection of objects as a list would be a bad practice.</small></li>
            <li><b>Use searchable variables and constants when needed.</b> <br/><small>Use a constant eg. <i>MIN_AGE_REQ=18 </i> if you gonna use the same value in other places. You would have to simply change the value of this constant only once to satisfy the new requirement when needed.</small></li>
            <li><b>Class names and objects should always be nouns.</b> <br/><small>Avoid generic and language-specific technical names like <i> Info</i>, <i>Manager</i> and <i>Controller</i>.</small></li>
            <li><b>Method names should have a verb or verb phrase like <i> get</i>, <i>set </i>and <i>delete</i></b>.</li>
            <li><b>Decide a standard for names serving similar purposes like <i> getters</i> and <i>setters</i>.</b></li>
            <li><b>Use context with variable names wherever is necessary.</b> <br/><small>Using the variable name, <i>member_address_state</i> for the state object inside a class <i>MemberAddress</i> would be more meaningful than just generic <i>state</i> name.</small></li>

        </ul>

        <p>In the next post, I'm gonna talk about naming classes in programming, focusing mainly on the three most popular CSS methodologies:  OOCSS, BEM and SMACSS. </p>

        {/* <p className="Post_subtitle">CSS Methodology.</p>
        <p>Now letâ€™s talk about CSS methodology. Naming classes in programming is as much important as naming variables. I'm gonna look at the three most popular conventions: OOCSS, BEM and SMACSS</p>

        <p>CSS methodologies give you a system to manage and optimize your CSS codes. They can be combined together, like OOCSS-SMACSS, or OOCSS-BEM, or BEM-SAMCSS to suit your needs. However, which ever you chose it is important to stick to that convention throughout (at least) the entire project.</p> */}
